DeCartography is a computational oracle that provides “Plurality Social Diversity” between wallet addresses based on on-chain activity on Ethereum.

Developers using this oracle can retrieve the Plurality Social Diversity of a given wallet address and other wallet addresses or groups (which is a list of wallet addresses) in GraphQL.

The data used to generate the social graph is determined by the crowdworker. Crowdworkers are rewarded by solving Common Sense Task displayed on the platform.

The goal is to collect subjective ratings from each crowdworker and use the “wisdom of crowds” to provide a social graph that is as close to objective as possible.
